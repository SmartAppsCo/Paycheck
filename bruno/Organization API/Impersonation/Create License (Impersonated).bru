  Request fields:
  - product_id: (required) Product ID to create license for
  - email: (optional) Customer email - enables license recovery via /activation/request-code
  - customer_id: (optional) Your internal customer identifier
  - license_exp_days: (optional) Override license expiration (days from now, null for perpetual)
  - updates_exp_days: (optional) Override updates expiration (days from now)
  - count: (optional) Number of licenses to create (1-100, default: 1)

  Returns:
  {
    "items": [{
      "id": "lic_xxx",
      "email_hash": "abc123...",
      "project_id": "proj_xxx",
      "product_id": "prod_xxx",
      "customer_id": "your-customer-123",
